Dialog System:

	[Current Dialog System]
		Dialog is typed into the dialog box
			-could continue with this if you want
		Easy to make text appear on screen
		Hard to switch things like portraits
		Hard to color the text
		Hard to emphesize text style (slow, line by line etc)
		Can't interact with the scene at all besides pawns, which are unrelyable
		
	[New Dialog System]
		- Want to be able to effect scripts from just text
		- Want to be able to color text, and draw text at whatever speed I want
		- Change the portraits easy
		- Want it to still be text based but easier to edit
		- Easier Yes/No decisions
		
		
		
[Cutscene Characters]
	- Keeps track of who is talking, their name and their portraits
	- Has a portraits array that has an identifing string and an image associated with it
[Cutscene Portraits]
	- A structure for portraits
	- Has a string and a sprite
	
	
	
Dialog Commands:

Text Based:

	Say(CharacterID,Text) [The bear minimum. Will use the last portrait saved]
	Say(CharacterID,Text,PortraidID) [Will change the portrait and then say the words]
	Continue(Text) [Rather then reset the line, the continue branch continues where we left off after we hit space]
	Continue(Text,PortraitID)
	WaitText() & EndWait() [WaitText starts a dialog that doesn't end until the script reaches EndWait()]
	
	
Saving Objects:

	LoadChar() [Loads and saves a character into a dictionary for future use]
	LoadPerm() [Loads and saves an IPermenant object in a dictionary for future use]
