Wanted Story Theming

-I like deconstructions of story types
	-Like, Madoka Magika was a deconstruction of the 'Magical Girl' trope right?
		-It tricked you into thinking it was going to be another happy go lucky magical girl anime
		-Then they fucking killed Hina
	-I'm not sure how to do this for Odyssey.
		-It could be a deconstruction on the 'Lets go on an adventure!' trope but like how?
		-It's something taken seriously, so do we not take it seriously? Then we just have Undertale/Earthbound right?

-Problems with old story
	-Didn't do well with the Odyssey name. It wasn't really an Odyssey right
	-No constant theme
	-Characters and situations were forced through the Lyser Mercenaries group, which feels a little chringy

	In Odyssey, everything is left and no one is right
	
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Everything starts to go wrong for Slas when on a scrapping mission in an abandoned laberatory finds the last of an ancient race in a stasis chamber.
	
	
	Slas is an Amtac in debt to Lindonese Lyser, a techie who has difficulty staying out of trouble.
	
	With the addition of the Vilo-imitator [Lynn: Too Close to Lindonese] [Sylvi] this causes tension between Slas and Lyser.
		-Because Slas already owes Lyser, she isn't happy about yet another mouth to feed
		-She knows she can't leave Sylvi out to the wolves, especially when Sylvi begs her to let her chip in and help
	
		
	With that starts the journey of Slas, Sylvi and Lyser.
		-Slas' first order of business after
		
		
	Ideas:
		
		
	Other Conflicts:
		-Slas' first order of business is to get information from a source on one of Mahr's stations
			-Upon getting the information he needs, he is identified by a small group of bounty hunters
			-You beat them, obviously but this establishes that Slas isn't exactly a great father figure
			
		-All Sylvi wanted was to be free to explore the universe
			-Her imprisonment and subsiquential placement in stasis robbed her of this
			
		-Over the course of the game Tabitha, Talem Mahr's wife, watches Slas and Sylvi's actions carefully, and eventually identifies Sylvi as her older sister
			-Sylvi was imprissoned for a long while, however the immortal race and subsiquent stasis means she never aged
			-This causes Tabitha to have Sylvi kidnapped and questioned
				-It is revealed that Tabitha is in fact Sylvis younger sister and Tabitha asks that Sylvi rejoin her to bring the Vilos back to power
				-Sylvi declines on account of her freedom still being robbed
				-Tabitha isn't happy, but ultimately understands her sisters choice and releases her
			-This action however causes the beginning of the climax of the story, as Slas is not informed that Sylvi is released and is sent to rescue her
				-which eventually ends with him killing Tabitha
				
		-Tabitha affectionally refers to Slas as 'the friendly neighborhood troublemaker'
		
		
		-Slas and Lyser are a team of Vigils
			-Vigils are mercenaries for hire that do jobs for people for cash
				-The catch is they don't know who they're being paid by
				-The problem with space is that there's well, too much space and not enough helpers
				-Vigils get paid for these jobs, reguardless of how ethical it is and the money goes back into the economy
