Zones:
	Control Camera and Size
	MiniTrigger Zones
		When enter, spawn/activate enemies
		Has a field for camera action
	Keeps track of Permanents
	Sends this Permanents data to the GameManager for saving

		
Non-Units:
	Has an activated method -> ????
		Called when the game starts and when the player enters the zone
	Has a triggerd boolean 
	Has a destroyed boolean
	Has an onHit function (because sometimes non-units need to be able to die)
		See: Scrap containers
	
Units:
	Has a destroyed boolean -> Damageable
	Has an activated method -> ????
	Has a Weapon interface -> Armed
	Has a healthVisualizer -> Damageable + Armed
	Has a gameObject reference -> Armed or Damageable
	Has an OnHit -> Damageable
	Has an OnDeath -> Damageable
	
	
	
	
	
New Idea: Permanent -> Damageable -> Armed

Permanent are any object in game that interacts with other Permanent
	Activate()
		Called when the scene starts and when the player enters the zone
		Primarily used for saving data, like position, is the object alive or not, etc etc
	Triggered()
		A boolean flag for most objects to interact with others. It's just good to have a logic based method

Damageable objects are any objects in the game that interact with bullets or taking damage in general
	Health reference
	OnHit()
	OnDeath() or Destroyed()
	HealthVisualizer reference
		Optional. Some objects (Scrap containers) don't need healthbars

Armed objects are any objects that have a weapon and look to deal damage to other damageable objects
										(It is impossible to have an armed object that isn't damageable)
	Weapon reference
	Shield reference
	
	
	
	
Asside: Weapons
	Armed reference
	List<BulletObjects>
	WeaponInfo struct
	isReloading boolean
	FireWeapon()
	ForceReload()
