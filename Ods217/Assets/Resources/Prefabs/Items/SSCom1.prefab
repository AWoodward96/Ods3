  Description: "\"Something has gone terribly wrong. We were on route to the Outpost
    when the ship suddenly and unexpectidly changed route.\r\nNone of the passengers
    have noticed yet, I fear I'm the only one aware. The Server bots are going missing
    one by one. If they've all broken down\r or are being destroyed by someone on
    board I don't know.\r\nThe Reception Bots won't let me anywhere near the escape
    pods unless it's an absolute emergency. Some sort of failsafe to stop a panic
    should someone bail on the cruise.\r\nI'm fearing the worst. I hope I'm wrong
    but just in case I'll leave behind these logs just in case I don't make it.\n-S\""
